# Description
This is for the course "CSE5522/Advanced Artificial Intelligence", the graduate level course of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State Unversity. And I attached our course link [here](https://cocoxu.github.io/courses/5522_autum18.html).

There are some projects, including Pacman search (project 1), Multi-agent search (project 2), Reinforcement learning (project 3) and other incoming projects.

# Project 1/Search

## Description

In this project, your Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.

## More details

You can check this [website](https://cocoxu.github.io/courses/5522_hw/project1.html) for more details.

# Project 2/Multi-agent search

## Description

In this project, you will design agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, you will implement both minimax and expectimax search and try your hand at evaluation function design.

The code base has not changed much from the previous project, but please start with a fresh installation, rather than intermingling files from project 1.

## More details

You can check this [website](https://cocoxu.github.io/courses/5522_hw/project2.html) for more details.

# Project 3/Reinforcement learning

## Description

In this project, you will implement value iteration and Q-learning. You will test your agents first on Gridworld (from class), then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.

## More details

You can check this [website](https://cocoxu.github.io/courses/5522_hw/project3.html) for more details.
